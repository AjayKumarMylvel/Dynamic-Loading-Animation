# Dynamic Loading Animation with HTML & CSS

A simple yet dynamic loading animation built using **HTML** and **CSS**. This project demonstrates a smooth, responsive loader with animated circles. The loader is designed for accessibility and optimized for different screen sizes.

## 🔍 **Features**

- Smooth animation with keyframes for resizing circles.
- **Cubic-bezier timing function** for natural easing effects.
- Modular styling with **multiple classes** for customization.
- **ARIA accessibility** label for better user experience with screen readers.
- Fully responsive design, working well on all screen sizes.

## 🧑‍💻 **Technologies Used**

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Keyframes, Cubic-bezier)
- Accessibility (ARIA)

## 🚀 **How It Works**

1. **HTML Structure**: The loader is created with `<div>` elements, organized using classes (`.loader`, `.loading`, `.one`, `.two`, etc.).
2. **CSS Animations**: The animation is controlled using `@keyframes`, which allows the circles to shrink and grow in a loop. The **cubic-bezier** timing function gives it a smooth, realistic bounce.
3. **Accessibility**: `aria-label="Content is loading..."` is added to the loader to improve accessibility for users with disabilities, ensuring screen readers provide context to the content being loaded.
